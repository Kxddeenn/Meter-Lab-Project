# Meter Lab Certificate Generation 💻

The purpose of this project is to find a solution to the VBA macros in the Excel files. 
VBA is arguably a dated language and there are many issues with its compatibility especially with growing technology around the world. 

Currently, the team is using a variety of macro scripts to automate the generation of the certificates.
This was effective maybe 10 years ago, but today the world uses more complex, smoother code to automate processes. 

A brief overview of the project was to have a User Interface, and better functionality to lessen the risk of potential damage and make the process smoother.
